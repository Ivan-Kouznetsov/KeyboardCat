# KeyboardCat
This is a Windows application that uses heuristics to detect a cat walking or standing on the keyboard and prevents keyboard events from being processed once feline keyboard interaction has been detected.
It then rechecks if the cat is still on the keyboard periodically and if no cat is detected, it allows keyboard events to be processed as normal.

## Requirements 

* Windows 
* .NET Framework
